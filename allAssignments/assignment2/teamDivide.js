 *  The number of members on each team must be as balanced as possible. 
 * In other words, if not all the teams can have the same number of members
 *  then some of the teams will have only one more member than the other teams. 
 * Your program must output a phrase that tells the teacher how to divide her class into teams.
 *  For example, if the teacher entered 22 class members and 5 teams,
 *  your program must output "2 teams with 5 members and 3 teams with 4 members." 
 * Your program must list the larger teams first.
