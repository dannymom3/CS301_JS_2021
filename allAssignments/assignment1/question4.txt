Q4. Write at least two algorithms you perform on your daily life, with at least
 one algorithm that can be convertedto computer program
 ANSWER: ==> algorithm -- in order to go to class:
 1. getup in the morning 2. take a shower or washing hands and face 3. get reeady the materials
 like computer and other learning materials 4. walk / or drive to class

 ==> algorithm to get the net pay from the regular wage amount working with 
 regular hours
 1. enter a regular hours
 2. enter a regular wage amount 
 3. get the regular pay by multiplying regular hour with regular wage
 4. get the tax amount by multiplying the tax percentage with regular pay
 5. get the net pay by subtructing the tax amount from regular pay


 ==> the above set of instructions of the algorithms aree looks like the following
 
const prompt = require("prompt-sync")();
let regHours = prompt("Enter the regular hours: ");
let regWage = prompt("Enter the regular wage amount: ");
let regPay = (regHours * regWage);
let tax = (regPay * 0.15);
let netPay = regPay - tax;

console.log(netPay);
