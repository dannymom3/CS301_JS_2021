Q1.What happens when you forget a break while using switch statement?
  answer: The program without break continous to the next labeled statement, executing the statement 
          until a break or the end of the statement is reached.

Q2. What will be the output of running following code?
     var foo = 0;
       switch(foo){
           case-1:
             console.log('negative1');
             break;
          case0:
             console.log(0);
           case1:
             console.log(1);
             break;
           case2:
           console.log(2);
             break;
           default:
             console.log('default');
        }
        answer: since, in case 0, we don't have a break so that it keeps to excute our code 
                until it reached to the next break statement. Therefore, case 0 and case 1
                will be executed because there is a break on case 1.
                The outputs are 0 and 1 (0 on case 0 and 1 on case 1).

Q3. Will output change if value of foo is a ‘0’ (0 in quotes) instead?
    answer: Yes!, because 0 in the quotes means we changed in to string. Therefore, the values will be 
          changed and will execute the default value or any string value if we have that in our cases.
