        <p>My name is <strong>Daniel Haile.</strong> Originally, I'm from <em>Ethiopia,</em> located on horn of Africa, in east of the continent. When I was a high school student, my dream was to be an engineer. After I completed a high school, I joined
            to <strong>Hawassa university, Ethiopia, </strong>five years bachelor degree programe for civil engineering. when I was a fifth year student i.e. same year for my graduation, I got a chance of U.S. diversity visa lottory. I moved to <em>Washington, Seattle since 2017.</em></p>
        <p>When I came to Seattle, I completly changed my mind about my professional goals. I want to be a good software developer. The reason why I want to be a software developer is because of I'm a big fan of technology and I want to know something new
            in every activity of my life.</p>
        <p>My biggest <em><strong>passion</strong></em> is helping people as much as I can and see smiling on their face because that makes me smile too more than anything I do. Sometimes I enjoying myself by watching any kind of sport events like soccer
            or American football, reading books, watching documentary movies and sketching a drawing.</p>
