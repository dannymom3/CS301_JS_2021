Q1. What are alternatives to default parameters?

    answer: Default parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default
            values if no value or undefined is passed.
            If a parameter is not provided, then its value becomes undefined
            If we want to use a “default” value instead, then we can specify it after =
            Example: function multiply(a, b = 1){
                return a * b;
            }
            console.log(multiply(5, 2)); //expected answer -- 10
            console.log(multiply(5)); //expected answer -- 5


Q2. What are things you should consider while naming a function?
    answer: choose a word with meaning
            Avoid generic names
            Don't make your name too long or too short
            Use consistent formatting
